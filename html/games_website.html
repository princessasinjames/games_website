    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h3 class="center">🛸 Animal Crossing (New Horizons)</h3>
    <p>Animal Crossing New Horizons is a game about befriending animals,
    exploring temporary islands, and build a base with things that you find or buy.
    These things can be bought from "Nook's Crany" (a market that changes its inverntory every day to something else),
    villagers who randomly sell stuff throughout the game, NPC's from "Harv's Island", and several other sources 
    (like the "Abel Sisters").

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <h3 class="center">🛸 Minecraft</h3>
    <p>Minecraft is a game where you can try to survive in a world with/without monsters, or build infinitely 
    in a creative world where you cannot die of natural causes. There are many animals in Minecraft which can be 
    helpful for survival, especially if you create a farm. This is an interesting way to survive in the game, 
    since alternatives are growing crops for days, fishing after crafting/finding a fishing rod, 
    eating rotten flesh from zombies which come out at night, or trying to find random edible food items 
    (i.e. sweet berries and mushrooms). Building is another fun part of the game, since there are so many 
    things you can build with and many different kinds of wood, including cherry wood, which is adorably pink.
