    <h3 class="center">🛸 Animal Crossing (New Horizons)</h3>
    <p>Animal Crossing New Horizons is a game about befriending animals,
    exploring temporary islands, and build a base with things that you find or buy.
    These things can be bought from "Nook's Crany" (a market that changes its inverntory every day to something else),
    villagers who randomly sell stuff throughout the game, NPC's from "Harv's Island", and several other sources 
    (like the "Abel Sisters").

    <h3 class="center">🛸 Fall Guys</h3>
    <p>Fall Guys is a game where you mainly compete with other players to reach a finish line. 
    There are different modes of the game such as solo, duos, squads, ranked, and special rounds. Solo games involve joining solo competitions 
    for first place in a series of matches. Duos involves competing in a similar way, but with another person. 
    That person could be a friend or random. Squads is similar, though you can have up to 4 players in a team. 
    Ranked matches can give rewards at the end of the season depending on your rank. Some players display 
    these rewards in game for bragging rights, intimidating, or host of other personal reasons. Special matches 
    occur on unique maps that come and go. There is also a battle pass with free and paid rewards. These rewards 
    are usually cosmetic (like a new skin, emoticon, or phrase).

    <h3 class="center">🛸 Stardew Valley</h3>
    <p>Stardew Valley is a game where you mainly socialize with other villagers and build your farm with 
    a variety of crops, crafts, buildings, and barns. These relationships are arguably more complicated than 
    relationships in Animal Crossing. This is because these villagers have more hearts, various gifts that 
    either increase, decrease, or have little effect on their affection level, and you can marry some of them in game.

    <h3 class="center">🛸 Solitaire</h3>
    <p>Solitaire is nice because you can play it both online and offline. It is a way to pass time when bored.
    It it somewhat of a sorting game where you can only place cards of matching suits 
    (aces, hearts, clubs, and spades) in order from the ace to the king. It is a well-known game 
    which has many tutorials online. There are also many apps for solitaire and variations of the game 
    like, spider solitaire.

    <h3 class="center">🛸 Minecraft</h3>
    <p>Minecraft is a game where you can try to survive in a world with/without monsters, or build infinitely 
    in a creative world where you cannot die of natural causes. There are many animals in Minecraft which can be 
    helpful for survival, especially if you create a farm. This is an interesting way to survive in the game, 
    since alternatives are fishing after crafting/finding a fishing rod, eating rotten flesh from zombies which only spawn at night, 
    growing crops for days, or trying to find random edible food items 
    (i.e. sweet berries and mushrooms). Building is another part of the game which I like, 
    since there are so many things you can build with and many different 
    kinds of wood, including cherry wood, which is adorably pink.
